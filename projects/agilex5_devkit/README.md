## GHRD Overview
![Block Diagram Baseline-A55 GHRD Overview](../../images/oobe-baseline-overview.png)

## Hard Processor System (HPS)
The GHRD HPS configuration matches the board schematic.
Refer to [Agilex 5 Hard Processor System Technical Reference Manual](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346/current) and [Hard Processor System Component Reference Manual: Agilex 5 SoCs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/813752/current) for more information on HPS configuration.

## HPS External Memory Interfaces (EMIF) DDR
The GHRD HPS EMIF DDR configuration matches the board schematic.
Refer to [External Memory Interfaces (EMIF) IP User Guide: Agilex 5 FPGAs and SoCs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/817467/current) for more information on HPS EMIF configuration.

## Bridges
Bridges are used to move data between FPGA fabric and HPS logic.
Refer to [HPS Bridges](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346/current/bridges.html).

The HPS address map and the FPGA address map are the same for Agilex 5.
Refer to [Total Address Map Graphical](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346/current/total-address-map-graphical.html) for more information.

Therefore, when accessing HPS logic in uboot or linux, the base address would be the same as, when using [NiosV Subsystem](#niosv-subsystem) from FPGA fabric.

| Bridge   | Use Case |
| :-- | :-- |
| F2SDRAM  | move data from FPGA fabric to HPS logic (non-coherent). Can access HPS EMIF. |
| F2S      | move data from FPGA fabric to HPS logic (coherent). Can access all HPS peripherial except the GIC. |
| LWS2F    | move data from HPS logic to FPGA fabric. Access FPGA peripherial Control Status Register (CSR). |
| H2F      | move data from HPS logic to FPGA fabric. Access FPGA Onchip Memory as scratch pad.    |

## Fabric Subsystem

### NiosV Subsystem
In the NiosV subsystem, the JTAG Avalon Master Bridge IP interface allows access to the peripherals in the FPGA with System Console. This access does not rely on HPS software drivers. Refer to this [Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683819/current/analyzing-and-debugging-designs-with-84752.html) for information about system console.

### Peripherals
| Peripheral | Address Offset | Size (bytes) | Attribute | Interrupt Number
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| sysid | 0x0001_0000 | 8 | Unique system ID   | None |
| led_pio | 0x0001_0080 | 16 | LED outputs   | None |
| button_pio | 0x0001_0060 | 16 | Push button inputs | 0 |
| dipsw_pio | 0x0001_0070 | 16 | DIP switch inputs | None |

#### Notes
- There are 4 user DIP switch inputs, 4 user push-button inputs and 4 LED outputs that is connected to fpga pins on Agilex 5 FPGA E-Series 065B Premium Development Kit.
  -  Only the lower three bits of LED outputs are available for software to control. The most significant bit of the LED is used in GHRD top module as heartbeat led. This LED blinks when the fpga design is loaded. Users will not be able to control this LED with HPS software, for example U-Boot or Linux.
- The peripheral components in fabric subsystem can be accessed via the LWS2F bridge and have offset of 0x0_2000_0000. Refer to [Total Address Map Graphical](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346/current/total-address-map-graphical.html).
- The FPGA IRQ has offset of 17 when mapped to Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) in device tree structure(dts). Refer to fpga2hps_interrupt_irq0[0] in [GIC Shared Peripheral Interrupts Map for the SoC HPS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/814346/current/gic-shared-peripheral-interrupts-map.html).

3. Click the play button to compile the design.
4. The compiled sof can be found in output_files folder of the project path.

### Using Command Line
1. Build the design sof
```bash
make baseline_a55-build

make baseline_a55-install-core-rbf
```
The generated core.rbf can be found in install/binaries folder.

## Simulation Steps
Follow the steps below to simulate the design using the testbench located in the design sim folder:
1. Prepare simulation scripts
   In the current project directory, run the following command to generate the necessary simulation scripts for QuestaSim, VCS (3-step), and Xcelium from Quartus:
```bash
make baseline_a55-prep
```

2. Run the Simulation
   Navigate to the sim directory
```bash
cd sim
```
   Depending on simulator license, execute the appropriate shell script to start the simulation. For example:
   For VCS (3-step) simulator,
```bash
./runvcs.sh
```
   For QuestaSim and Questa FE simulator,
```bash
./runquesta.sh
```
   For Xcelium simulator,
```bash
./runxcelium.sh
```
